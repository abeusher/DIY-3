# DIY-3
This is yet another DIY project for a self-balancing robot that can track objects autonomously, classify the objects via Tensorflow, Inception V3 model, and store the resulting metadata in a blockchain.

## Concept
The concept for this project was to show how a blockchain could be used when an organization wanted to improve the quality of their image classifications.  In this demo the business-network is made up of the robot, Jetson TX2 and a raspberry pi in the role of an analyst.



## Conceptual Achitecture

### Blockchain Schema
Below is the schema for storing image metadata in the blockchain with the participants are mapped to which attributes they create and or update
